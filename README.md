# Car Dynamics in Maya

Developed in 2003 this car simulation rig utilises basic Maya dynamics and was the template for the Toyota Kluger commercial. It still works in Maya today (tested in Maya 2020). Today there are car rigs available as plugins but at the time there were no car simulators available. This was developed as a solution and could still be used today. The embeded script to drive wheels is also useful.

## Getting Started

1) Open the file and hit rewind to frame 1. The car should sit off the ground and straight.
2) As per screen grab Set Initial State > Set for All Dynamic
3) Press play (ensure your playback preferences are set to play every frame and not real time)
